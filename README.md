I have so many beautiful images with nice color schemes. I wanted to grab inspiration from these images into my own projects, hence, I created this color pallette generator!

### Built With

Python3

```sh
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

2. Click on `browse` and select the image you want to extract the colors from.

3. Press `Generate` and voila! Now all you have to do is wait for your pallette to generate.

4. Note that since this is a free hosted site, generating the pallette may take ~10-20 seconds!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

At the moment, I have no future plans for this website. However, I could see perhaps batch generating color pallettes or exporting your color pallette colours into a csv or txt file.
